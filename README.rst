About rampedpyrox
-----------------

Rampedpyrox is a Python package for analyzing the results from ramped-temperature
instruments such as RampedPyrox, RockEval, pyrolysis gc (pyGC), thermogravimitry
(TGA), etc. Rampedpyrox deconvolves Gaussian activiation energy peaks within a given
sample using a Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) and calculates the
corresponding stable-carbon and radiocarbon isotope values for each peak.

Rampedpyrox is written by Jordon D. Hemingway (MIT/WHOI Joint Program). When using
rampedpyrox, please cite the following peer-reviewed publications:
